Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia, affecting 30 million people worldwide, yet treatment options remain limited. A key pathological feature, synaptic dysfunction strongly correlates with cognitive dysfunction and has been linked to proximity to amyloid- plaques, another pathological hallmark. A crucial component of proper synaptic function is mRNA metabolism, specifically, the stabilization, localization, and translation of transcripts producing proteins for synaptic function.  N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is a post-transcriptional methylation of adenosine residues in RNA and is a key mediator of mRNA metabolism including mRNA splicing, nuclear export, stability, and translation .  m6A RNA methylation is enriched in brain tissue and is dynamically regulated: it is added by methyltransferases such Mettl3 and Mettl14 (writers), removed by demethylases such as fat-mass-and-obesity related protein (FTO, an eraser), and recognized by a variety of m6A-bindng proteins (readers).  Disruption of m6A in mice leads to synaptic dysfunction and memory impairment. Notably, Mettl3 and Mettl14 protein levels are reduced in the neurons of AD patients. However, little is known about how the disruption of m6A RNA modifications contributes to synaptic dysfunction in Alzheimer’s disease. This has motivated me to make the role of m6A downregulation in synaptic dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease the focus of my PhD thesis. Stay tuned for updates of presentations, posters, and papers!
